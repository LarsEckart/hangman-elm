# GitHub Issue Creation Commands

## Issue 1: Magic Strings
```bash
gh issue create --title "Magic Strings" --body "**Observation:** The code uses several \"magic strings\" for CSS classes and other string literals. This makes the code harder to maintain and increases the risk of typos.

**Recommendation:** Extract these strings into constants or helper functions.

**Example in `Main.elm`:

```elm
-- Before
viewStartScreen : Html Msg
viewStartScreen =
    div [ class \"screen start-screen\" ]
        [ h1 [ class \"game-title\" ] [ text \"ðŸŽ¯ HANGMAN GAME\" ]
        , p [ class \"game-description\" ] [ text \"Guess the word letter by letter!\" ]
        , button [ class \"start-button\", onClick StartGame ] [ text \"Start Game\" ]
        ]

-- After
-- It's recommended to create a `ViewConstants` or similar module.
module ViewConstants exposing (..)

appTitle : String
appTitle = \"ðŸŽ¯ HANGMAN GAME\"

startScreenClass : String
startScreenClass = \"screen start-screen\"
-- ... other constants

-- In Main.elm
viewStartScreen : Html Msg
viewStartScreen =
    div [ class ViewConstants.startScreenClass ]
        [ h1 [ class ViewConstants.gameTitleClass ] [ text ViewConstants.appTitle ]
        -- ...
        ]
```"
```

## Issue 2: Redundant `Char.toLower` Calls
```bash
gh issue create --title "Redundant `Char.toLower` Calls" --body "**Observation:** In `GameLogic.elm`, `Char.toLower` is called repeatedly on the same values within functions.

**Recommendation:** Convert characters to lowercase once at the beginning of the function and reuse the result. This will slightly improve performance and readability.

**Example in `GameLogic.elm`:

```elm
-- Before
isValidGuess : Char -> List Char -> Bool
isValidGuess char guessedLetters =
    let
        lowerChar = Char.toLower char
        lowerGuessed = List.map Char.toLower guessedLetters
    in
    Char.isAlpha char && not (List.member lowerChar lowerGuessed)

-- After
isValidGuess : Char -> List Char -> Bool
isValidGuess char guessedLetters =
    let
        lowerChar = Char.toLower char
    in
    Char.isAlpha char && not (List.member lowerChar guessedLetters)
```
*Note: The `guessedLetters` list should ideally be stored in lowercase to begin with, which would remove the need for `List.map Char.toLower` in multiple functions.*"
```

## Issue 3: Complex `update` Function
```bash
gh issue create --title "Complex `update` Function" --body "**Observation:** The `update` function in `Main.elm` is large and handles many different messages. This can make it difficult to understand and maintain.

**Recommendation:** Break down the `update` function into smaller, more focused functions. Each function can handle a specific message or a group of related messages.

**Example in `Main.elm`:

```elm
-- Before
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        StartGame ->
            -- ...
        SelectLanguage language ->
            -- ...
        -- ... and so on

-- After
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
    case msg of
        StartGame ->
            handleStartGame model
        
        SelectLanguage language ->
            handleSelectLanguage language model
        
        -- ... and so on

handleStartGame : Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
handleStartGame model =
    { model 
      | currentScreen = LanguageSelection
      , errorMessage = Nothing
      }
    , Cmd.none
    )

handleSelectLanguage : Language -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
handleSelectLanguage language model =
    { model 
      | selectedLanguage = Just language
      , currentScreen = CategorySelection
      }
    , Cmd.none
    )
```"
```

## Issue 4: Initial Model State
```bash
gh issue create --title "Initial Model State" --body "**Observation:** The `initialModel` in `Types.elm` could be simplified. Some of the initial values are redundant or could be derived from other state.

**Recommendation:** Simplify the `initialModel` to only include the essential initial state.

**Example in `Types.elm`:

```elm
-- Before
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { currentScreen = Start
    , selectedLanguage = Nothing
    , selectedCategory = Nothing
    , selectedDifficulty = Nothing
    , currentWord = \"\"
    , guessedLetters = []
    , remainingGuesses = maxGuesses
    , gameState = Playing
    , userInput = \"\"
    , errorMessage = Nothing
    , wordList = []
    }

-- After
initialModel : Model
initialModel =
    { currentScreen = Start
    , selectedLanguage = Nothing
    , selectedCategory = Nothing
    , selectedDifficulty = Nothing
    , currentWord = \"\"
    , guessedLetters = []
    , remainingGuesses = maxGuesses
    , gameState = Playing
    , userInput = \"\"
    , errorMessage = Nothing
    , wordList = []
    }

-- The `resetGame` function can be used to reset the game state
-- instead of setting all the fields in the `PlayAgain` message handler.
resetGame : Model -> Model
resetGame model =
    { model
    | currentWord = \"\"
    , guessedLetters = []
    , remainingGuesses = maxGuesses
    , gameState = Playing
    , userInput = \"\"
    , errorMessage = Nothing
    , wordList = []
    }
```"
```

## Issue 5: View Functions
```bash
gh issue create --title "View Functions" --body "**Observation:** The view functions in `Main.elm` are well-organized, but some of the view logic could be further simplified and made more reusable.

**Recommendation:** Create smaller, reusable view components. For example, the buttons in the selection screens are very similar and could be extracted into a reusable function.

**Example in `Main.elm`:

```elm
-- Reusable button component
selectionButton : String -> msg -> Html msg
selectionButton label msg =
    button [ class \"selection-button\", onClick msg ] [ text label ]

-- In viewLanguageSelection
viewLanguageSelection : Html Msg
viewLanguageSelection =
    div [ class \"screen language-screen\" ]
        [ h2 [ class \"screen-title\" ] [ text \"Choose Language\" ]
        , div [ class \"selection-buttons\" ]
            [ selectionButton \"ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English\" (SelectLanguage English)
            , selectionButton \"ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German\" (SelectLanguage German)
            , selectionButton \"ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª Estonian\" (SelectLanguage Estonian)
            ]
        ]
```"
```

## Issue 6: Error Handling
```bash
gh issue create --title "Error Handling" --body "**Observation:** The error handling is basic and relies on a `Maybe String` for error messages.

**Recommendation:** For a more robust application, consider using a dedicated error type. This allows for more structured error handling and can make the code easier to debug.

**Example in `Types.elm`:

```elm
type alias Model =
    { -- ...
    , error : Maybe AppError
    }

type AppError
    = NoWordsAvailable
    | InvalidGuess String
    | NetworkError String -- For future use

-- In Main.elm, the update function would then handle these structured errors.
```"
```

## Issue 7: Testing
```bash
gh issue create --title "Testing" --body "**Observation:** The project has some tests, which is a great start. However, the test coverage could be improved, especially for the `update` function in `Main.elm`.

**Recommendation:** Add more tests to cover the different branches of the `update` function. This will help to ensure that the application behaves as expected and will make it easier to refactor the code with confidence. Consider using a tool like `elm-test` to run the tests."
