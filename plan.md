# Implementation Plan for Open Issues

This document outlines the recommended implementation order for all open GitHub issues in the hangman-elm project.

## Overview

Based on analysis of 8 open issues, this plan prioritizes code quality improvements first, followed by architectural refactoring, and concludes with testing and user experience enhancements.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Code Quality

### Issue #3: Extract magic strings into constants
- **Priority**: High (Quick win)
- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Improves maintainability, reduces typos
- **Files**: `src/ViewConstants.elm` (new), `src/Main.elm`
- **Description**: Centralize hardcoded CSS classes and UI strings

### Issue #4: Optimize redundant Char.toLower calls
- **Priority**: High (Performance)
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Performance improvement, cleaner code
- **Files**: `src/GameLogic.elm`, `src/Main.elm`, `tests/GameLogicTest.elm`
- **Description**: Store guessed letters in lowercase to eliminate repeated conversions

### Issue #6: Simplify initial model state
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Low
- **Impact**: Code reusability, easier testing
- **Files**: `src/Types.elm`, `src/Main.elm`
- **Description**: Extract `resetGame` function for better state management

## Phase 2: Architecture & Maintainability

### Issue #5: Break down complex update function
- **Priority**: High (Enables better testing)
- **Effort**: High
- **Impact**: Improved maintainability, easier testing
- **Files**: `src/Main.elm`, `tests/UpdateTest.elm`
- **Description**: Split large update function into focused message handlers

### Issue #7: Create reusable view components
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: UI consistency, reduced duplication
- **Files**: `src/Main.elm`, possibly `src/View/` modules
- **Description**: Extract common UI patterns into reusable components

### Issue #2: Implement structured error handling
- **Priority**: Medium (Type safety)
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Better error categorization, type safety
- **Files**: `src/Types.elm`, `src/Main.elm`, `tests/`
- **Description**: Replace `Maybe String` with structured `AppError` type

## Phase 3: Testing & User Experience

### Issue #8: Improve test coverage for update function
- **Priority**: High (After refactoring)
- **Effort**: High
- **Impact**: Confidence in refactoring, regression detection
- **Files**: `tests/UpdateTest.elm`, possibly `tests/ViewTest.elm`
- **Description**: Comprehensive testing of all message handlers and state transitions

### Issue #1: Mobile responsiveness
- **Priority**: Medium (User-facing)
- **Effort**: High
- **Impact**: Better mobile user experience
- **Files**: `main.html`, CSS in Elm view functions
- **Description**: Responsive design, touch-friendly interface, viewport optimization

## Implementation Strategy

### Why This Order?

1. **Foundation First**: Simple wins (#3, #4, #6) improve code quality without breaking changes
2. **Architecture Second**: Major refactoring (#5, #7, #2) is easier with clean foundation
3. **Validation Last**: Testing (#8) validates refactored code, UX (#1) is most complex

### Dependencies

- Issue #8 should come after #5 (testing the refactored update function)
- Issue #2 benefits from #5 being complete (structured errors in message handlers)
- Issue #1 can be done independently but benefits from #7 (reusable components)

### Risk Mitigation

- Each phase can be implemented and tested independently
- Breaking changes are front-loaded in early phases
- Testing improvements come before the most complex feature
- User-facing changes are saved for last to minimize disruption

## Success Metrics

- All 53 existing tests continue to pass
- New functionality is thoroughly tested
- Code complexity is reduced (measured by function length and cyclomatic complexity)
- Mobile usability is improved (tested on actual devices)
- No regression in game functionality
